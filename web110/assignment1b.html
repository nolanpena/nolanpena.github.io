    <p>Activity 3... Having finished the "How to Save a Document" WikiHow tutorial, I now know how important it is to save my work digitally. I now know how important it is to choose the right file type and location for my documents so that they may be conveniently retrieved in the future. This ability is essential in any setting, academic or professional, because keeping organization requires accurate documentation. The "Copy Documents to a USB Flash Drive from Your Computer" article taught me how to safely backup and move files. In order to prevent data damage, I now know how to safely remove a USB device after transferring files. Finally, the "How to Organize an Electronic Filing System" helped me understand the significance of having a well-organized digital file system. I learned how to name and organize files so that they are easily found. By putting these strategies into practice, I will be able to keep my digital workspace organized and clean while managing and retrieving information more quickly.</p>
    <p>The "Tracing Internet Traffic" section taught me how to use the `traceroute` (macOS/Linux) or `tracert` (Windows) command to follow the path that data packets take from my computer to a designated host, like en.wikiversity.org. I can determine where network delays or problems might be by examining this data, which represents each router or device that the data passes through. The HowToGeek tutorial gave useful advice on how to use traceroute to identify network issues. I learned how to analyze the data and pinpoint sluggish or unavailable routers, which can reveal the location of latency or failure in a connection. Using the online traceroute tool provided a visual representation of the route, allowing me to see the geographical path and understand the broad nature of internet traffic. In both personal and professional contexts, this knowledge is very useful for troubleshooting network issues. </p>
