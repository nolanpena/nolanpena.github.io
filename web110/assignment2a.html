    <h1>Assignment 2a</h1>
    <p>2: I learned how to install and compare multiple web browsers, which helped me understand the unique features and performance of each. Brave emphasizes privacy and security, making it a strong choice for users concerned about tracking and ads. Google Chrome is known for its speed and ease of use. Microsoft Edge, is usualy integrated with windows making a solid choice for new users but also impossible to uninstall without third party software. Mozilla Firefox stands out for its customizability and commitment to open-source principles, appealing to users who prioritize control over their browsing experience. Opera offers more integrated tools, such as an ad blocker and VPN, for users who want more features right in the browser. I was able to better understand how these browsers satisfy various needs and preferences for browsing habits by comparing them.</p>
    <p>4: While configuring browser settings, I learned how customization options can significantly impact user experience and security. For instance, I found that fine-tuning privacy settings in browsers such as Firefox and Brave improves security against tracking and advertisements. Additionally, I learned about managing site permissions and cookies, which is essential for limiting data sharing and protecting privacy. I was able to customize the browsing experience to my liking by adding features like ad blockers,Â by configuring extensions in Chrome and Edge. I looked at startup behavior, default search engines, and bookmark management settings to see how these affect how efficient a browser is. I also discovered how crucial it is to keep browser updates current in order to preserve security and functionality. In general, changing the browser's settings gave me a deeper understanding of how to optimize and secure my browsing environment.</p>
