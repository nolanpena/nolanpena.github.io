    <p>3 By doing this activity this search, I discovered that using exact phrases can greatly improve search results. For example, when I searched for "search engine" and "market share," the results were more specific to search engine and market share. In contrast, searching without quotes produced a wider range of results, many of which were less relevant. I can see myself using this technique in future research, especially if I need specific information for my IT studies. If i'm looking for precise technical terms or searching for academic resources, using exact phrases will help me quickly find the most relevant content, saving time and improving efficiency</p>
    <p>6 Using the Wayback Machine, I learned about the ability to view historical versions of web pages, including those that are no longer available on their original websites. This tool offers a unique way to access content that would otherwise be lost, providing a snapshot of the web at various points in time. For example, I was able to explore versions of the YouTube home page dating back to 2010, this helped me understand of how websites evolve over time. Also, discovering how to add a page URL to the Internet Archive to help preserve online content for future reference was interesting. This is especially useful in fields like information technology and cybersecurity, where historical data can can be useful for analysis</p>
