    <p>3 Through this project, I learned aboutÂ Mozilla Thunderbird as an email client. I discovered that it is a powerful open-source tool that combines email management with a calendar, contact book, RSS feed reader, and chat feature. Its cross-platform availability makes it accessible to a wide range of users, and its community-driven nature gives it a distinct, user-focused edge. Setting up my email account in Thunderbird demonstrated how the software simplifies the normally complex task of email configuration by automatically detecting server settings. This not only streamlined the setup process, but also demonstrated Thunderbird's user-friendly design. This experience helped me understand how Thunderbird can manage communication and personal information.

    <p>4 During this activity, I learned how to read email message headers, which are important for determining the origin of an email. Reviewing Wikipedia's information on email spoofing helped me understand how malicious actors can forge sender addresses, emphasizing the importance of verifying email authenticity. Following instructions for Mozilla Thunderbird and other webmail services, I was able to access the headers of a received message. This enabled me to analyze the From: address and track the email's path through servers. This knowledge is critical for raising my email security awareness and avoiding potential phishing attacks in both personal and professional settings.</p>
