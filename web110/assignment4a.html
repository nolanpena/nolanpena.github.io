    <p>3. Verify Internet Connectivity: Performing the activity to verify Internet connectivity taught me essential network troubleshooting skills. I started by checking the physical connections to both wired and wireless networks. For wired connections, I examined the connectivity lights on the network adapter and the switch/router. For wireless, I confirmed a stable connection using the user interface. I also learned how to check IP address settings across multiple operating systems. Using commands like ipconfig on Windows and ifconfig on Linux and macOS helped me to learn how each system manages its network configuration.</p>
    <p>4. Share a folder and connect to the shared folder: This activity taught me how to share a folder on my Windows computer using the graphical user interface and how to connect to that shared folder from another computer using a network path. Following the instructions in Microsoft's File Sharing Essentials, I was able to create the folder, change the permissions, and make it accessible to other network devices. Using the network path to access the folder from a different computer show how important having the proper connectivity and security settings is. This hands-on experience taught me how file sharing works in a Windows environment and how to make sure other users can access shared resources. It also showed me how useful network paths are when it comes to accessing files directly across a network. Overall, it was a valuable lesson in managing shared resources effectively.</p>
