    <p>Activity 3. Completing this activity has helped me better understand computer security and the need of virus scanning. I discovered that utilizing anti malware software is important for protecting the computer from different kinds of malware, which include not just viruses but also malicious scripts that can run while visiting specific websites. Now, I scan my computer on a regular basis, particularly after installing new programs, to guarantee that no malware has been installed. Furthermore, I learnt how to utilize the test file to assess the efficiency of my anti-malware application, which allows me to ensure that it is working properly. Researching and comparing antivirus software has also helped me choose the finest security for my needs. These tips have helped me be more proactive in maintaining my computer's security, resulting in a safer digital environment.</p>
    <p>Activity 4. During my research on password managers and multi-factor authentication, I learned about the importance of protecting my online accounts. A password manager can assist me in creating and storing unique, difficult passwords for each of my accounts, therefore increasing security because i can have many unique passwords. I noticed that using long passwords, usually between 16 and 20 characters, is more beneficial than focusing simply on complexity. Furthermore, enabling multi-factor authentication increases security by requiring a second verification step, such as a number texted to a phone. Most accounts I have already have multi factor authentication on them, though my passwords are not very strong. I plan to implement these security measures on my Apple, Facebook, Google, and Microsoft accounts, as for the password manager I will probably just use the one built into my phone. Overall, these practices will significantly enhance my online security and protect my sensitive information from potential threats.</p>
