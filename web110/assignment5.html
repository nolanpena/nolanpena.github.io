    <h>Assignment 5</h>
    <p>Completing this homework taught me the fundamental principles of web programming, notably HTML. Organizing my files under the web110 folder was important to having a clear structure, keeping the names a similar format helps organize the html code easier. Creating a unordered list in the index.html file allowed me to reference all assignment pages using relative links, which helped with navigation. I also modified the HTML titles to match the assignment and inserted h1 elements to improve the content introduction. Validating my code with the W3C HTML Validator confirmed that it met web standards.</p>
