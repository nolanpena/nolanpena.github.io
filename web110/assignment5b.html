  <h1>Assignment 5b</h1>
  <p style="color:blue;">When I added external CSS to my website, I learned the benefit of separating content from style, which improves maintainability and readability. A CSS file can be linked using the link tag in the head section to ensure consistent styling across various pages. I learned how to properly arrange my CSS rules, using selectors, properties, and values to manage layout, colors, fonts, and spacing. Also, I learned about CSS's cascading nature, which allows styles to be changed based on specificity. This project taught me how external stylesheets enhance page load times and allow for easy design modifications without changing the HTML content.</p>
