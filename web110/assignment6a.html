  <h1>Assignment 6a</h1>
  <p>This session helped me learn about multimedia in web development. I learned how to use HTML tags to combine photos, and video into my website.  The process of making a new image, saving it to my website folder, and then linking it with a relative reference was simple. I found how to use the iframe tag to embed external content, such as YouTube videos.  The ability to add audio and video elements using audio and video tags, as well as specifying different file types for compatibility, is quite handy.  This information will be extremely useful in future projects, helping me to develop appealing web pages by combining multimedia content.
