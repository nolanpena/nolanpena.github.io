  <p>I submitted my web pages to the validator and instantly detected multiple markup issues. This experience taught me that even little errors, such as missing closing tags or using the wrong attribute, can alter how a page renders in different browsers. I took the effort to repair these problems, which helped me comprehend the right HTML structure. Finally, I discovered that following to these standards helps not only site performance but also the user experience by providing uniform behavior across multiple platforms.
