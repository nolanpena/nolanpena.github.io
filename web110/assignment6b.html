For example, it detected photographs that lacked alt text, which is critical for screen readers. I learned that resolving these accessibility challenges is critical to generating inclusive digital content. By following the tool's advice and making the necessary changes, I increased the usability of my pages, making them more accessible to all users, regardless of skill.
