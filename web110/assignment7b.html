  <h1>Assignment 7a</h1>
  <p>About Images in HTML, The goal of this final project is to educate viewers on the proper usage of images in HTML, emphasizing their importance in web design and user experience. This presentation will cover the syntax and characteristics of the '<img>' tag, as well as how to optimize pictures for performance and accessibility.  I hope to offer future WEB 110 students with practical skills to use in their own projects. The project will contain a clear explanation of the fundamental HTML structure, a live code example of picture inserting, and a discussion of important factors such as file size optimization and the usage of informative alt text.  </p>
