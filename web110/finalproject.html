    <title>Final project</title>
</head>
<body>
    This semester in WEB110, I learned about the internet and web development. I learned about the fundamentals of HTML and CSS, which are important for creating dynamic web pages. Exploring web design principles taught me the importance of user experience and accessibility. I discovered how to embed media, optimize images, and ensure responsive design for various devices. Additionally, I learned a bit about seo practices, enhancing visibility and searchability. in General, this course provided me with a solid foundation in web development, preparing me for future projects and a career in the tech industry.

    <P>Also the final project instructions are a bit confusing as it says leave your references in your presentation but my presentation is a video: so i will leave my references here,</P>
